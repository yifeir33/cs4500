/**
 * Sorer opens and parses a Schema-on-read text file,
 * and after catagorizing the file then allows a usert to retrieve
 * both column types and the value in the schema at <column> <row>.
 *
 * It works by using mmap to put the file into virtual memory. As the file
 * is Read-Only and the MAP_SHARED and MAP_NORESERVE flags are passed, it does not need the
 * physical memory to hold the file, the operating system will load and unload parts of the file
 * as needed. Furthermore it lazily looks up values by storing the index in the file
 * that each row starts on, and when a value is requested it parses that row on request.
 * This helps keep memory usage low, and since lines are unlikely to exceed a page of memory the 
 * performance hit of parsing is minimal.
